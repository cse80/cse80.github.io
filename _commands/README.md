Command Webpages
================

If you'd like to work on a the documentation for a command, first check if
there's an [open issue](https://github.com/cse80/cse80.github.io/issues) so that
you don't conflict with someone else's efforts.

If there's not an issue for what you want to work on, first open a new issue so
that others know you're working on it, then fix it!
