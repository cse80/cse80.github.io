which is the standard port number DNS's use to accept queries. 
* Below this is the lookup info of microsoft.com. Here we get 5 different addresses which indicates that when you access 
microsoft.com you may be directed to any of these servers.

* These are the DNS addresses associated with facebook.com
* An AAAA record is what associates a domain name with the specific IP address, so that the browser knows where to go to access the website. 
* AAAA is associated with IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) records and A is associated with IPv4 records. The eight groups of four hexademinal digits seperated by colons is the IPv6 address.
