## Alternatives to a PAM module
 - Install and compile OpenSSH from source while adding [this patch](https://gist.github.com/sjmurdoch/1572229).
 - Would get to tie in package managers (Week 12!)

# Scripting

```bash
# from create_initial_users.sh

# list of some default usernames to add
while IFS='' read -r user || [[ -n "$user" ]];
do
    ./honeypot_user.sh "$user"
done < "usernames.txt"
```

# Piping commands
- From [Lecture 6](http://leccap.engin.umich.edu/leccap/viewer/r/qlB5Sh)
 - `ifconfig enp0s3 | grep 'inet ' | tr -s "[:space:]" ":" | cut -d ":" -f 4`

- From the `Makefile`
 - `cat /var/log/passwords | cut -d';' -f3 | grep -vE '^[[:cntrl:]]|^[[:space:]]*$$' | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d ' ' | sort | uniq | tee -a usernames.txt`

# Security

## What to do about all these attempts?
 - Configure settings in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to prevent password based authentication
