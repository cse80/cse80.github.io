To access the course server outside of class, please follow these instructions:

=== From Windows:
Download and run
[PuTTY](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w32/putty.exe). In the new
window, type 'cse80.ucsd.edu' in the "Host Name (or IP address)" field, and then
click "Open". Follow the on-screen prompts for username and password.

It may ask you about trusting the host. You can answer yes to this question-- it
will only occur the first time you connect.

=== From macOS:
Open `Terminal.app`, either by searching via Spotlight, or by finding it
in your `Applications/Utilities` folder. Then type:

```ssh USERNAME@cse80.ucsd.edu```

It may ask you about the 'authenticity' of the host. You can answer yes to this
question-- it will only occur the first time you connect.
