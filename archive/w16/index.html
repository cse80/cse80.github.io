	<p>This 1-credit seminar is designed to teach the essentials of using a
	computer effectively for EECS students. While the target audience is CS/CE/DS
	students, any student wishing to learn how to use their computer much more
	effectively is encouraged to join. Topics covered include shells, environment,
	scripting, Makefiles, compilers, debugging tools, and version control. The
	last month of the course will be open to student input for remaining useful
	topics to cover.</p>

			Lecture opened with an example of an editor most people

			their behavior. Then we played with one of the first
			text editors, <tt>ed</tt>. The homework explores how
			some of <tt>ed</tt>'s interfaces live on today. From
			there we talked about the mental model of a software
			developer when editing software and how editors play
			into that. Finally, we closed lecture with a discussion
			on the distinction between text editors and source code
			editors, which of those are included in Integrated
			Development Environments (IDEs), and whether that is the
			right choice. The advanced homework explores how to
			bridge this gap in both directions, from source editor
			to IDE and from IDE with text editor to IDE with source
			editor.

            <p>This week we focused on build systems- which sound crazy complicated,
            but are actually built realized by simple concepts like graphs and 
            variables. In lecture, we started off by asking "What is a build system?
            Why do they matter? What do they help us do?"</p>
            <p>In the simplest case, a build system allows you to save build or
            compilation commands to variable names like 'all_tests' or 'submit'.
            This saves us from trying to remember the gcc arguments for each type
            of executable or test we want to make or run.</p>
            <p>In class, we focused on the 'make' program, which is a build system
            everyone should be familiar with from 280 and 281. We talked about the
            syntax of 'make' in terms of targets, dependencies, and rules, and
            demonstrated it's behavior with a quick example composed of shell 
            scripts.</p>

			<p>This week we talked about debuggers, specifically the gdb debugging
			utility. This lecture is a little different as early labs in other EECS
			classes have already introduced gdb, so everyone should already have at
			least a passing familiarity with gdb. What we try to go through in
			lecture then is to understand the primitives that gdb provides &ndash;
			the way that gdb lets us examine and modify machine state &ndash; and how
			to stitch those primitives together to debug.</p>
			<p>Said differently, recall that debugging is essentially a search
			problem: At the beginning you have a program starting to run with some
			inputs and at the end you have the final state with the incorrect outputs.
			Tracking down a bug requires finding when between a program's beginning
			and end things went from being correct to incorrect. A debugger, such as
			gdb, is a tool that lets you stop and examine any point in time between
			the beginning and end. It is up to you, however, to point the tool to the
			right points in time in order to identify where things went wrong.</p>

			<p>This lecture digs into git, trying to understand what's going on
			underneath the hood. We introduce the concept of branching and show how
			it affects history. Next we introduce merging, which bring branches back
			together. Then we introduce the concept of remotes and show how remote
			repositories are really just the same thing as branches.</p>

			<p>What we sadly did not quite have time to get to in class was the key
			git philosophy: <em>commit everything and commit often</em>. Some folks
			stuck around after the last lecture to go a little longer and talk
			through some of these ideas. The key thing is commit little pieces of
			progress. It is easy to get in a trap where you feel like you do not want
			to commit something until it is working. But if you only commit
			1,000-line changes after you have everything, then you may as well not be
			using version control!</p>

			<p>In the supplemental lecture, we introduced the concept of
			<em>feature branches</em>. The idea is that when you start working on
			something new, you can create a new branch for that feature. Since this
			branch is not yet part of the offical history, you should not feel bad
			about making lots of little commits as you get little pieces working.
			Once you get all of the way there, you can re-write history!

			<p>We also built up a small collection of
			<a href="lec/git-niceties">tips and tricks</a>
			to make working with git more enjoyable.

			A lighter week this week, we talked about profiling.
			</p>

			<p>
			Profilers are tools that help you understand where your code is spending
			its time. Profilers are <strong>not</strong> debugging tools. Your code
			needs to work and work as expected before a profiler will be useful.
			Profiling is the last step, optimization to help figure out how to improve
			your code.
			</p>

			<p>In lecture, we went through an understanding of how to build a basic
			profiler from scratch, showing the key concepts of operation. In practice,
			modern profilers do more (check out the advanced homework for some examples
			of this). We ended lecture looking at how to use the <tt>gprof</tt> tool,
			a real-world profiler.

			<p>This week we talked about Python. We used an

			<a href="https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/ppannuto/c4cs-w16-rpn" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<p>In lecture, we started with <code>rpn_basic.py</code>, working through
			its operation and Python constructs. Then we slowly starting fixing bugs
			and adding features. The idea was to progress towards the features in
			<code>rpn_class.py</code> during lecture.</p>

			<p>Beyond what we able to present in lecutre, the repository includes
			two more complete files, <code>rpn_class.py</code> which gives an example
			of how to make a Python class and <code>rpn_kitchen_sink.py</code>, a

			<p>Lecture this week starts from the idea of a local environment and what
			that really means. It is not just setting up your machine for
			&ldquo;development&rdquo;, it is setting it up for C++ development,
			for iOS development, for web development. Each of these environments are
			unique, and while there are some common threads (editors, version control),
			ultimately each has some things that make it unique.</p>

			<p>That idea brings us to the major topic, <em>package managers</em>. These
			are tools that help manage libraries, tools, building, distribution, or
			other things appropriate to the environment you are currently working in.
			Every environment has its own package management system. Ubuntu has apt,
			Python has pip, Ruby has gems, OS X has the App Store (it's a package
			manager, really!). In lecture we go over what a package manager has to do
			to achieve its goals and how it does it. Along the way we examine how
			package managers differ.</p>

			<p>As some closing thoughts, we look at how the philosophy of a development
			environment is changing from the older C/C++ model of a global system
			development environment to project-specific environments. We introduce
			the idea of virtual environments, their purpose, and how different tools
			manage these concepts. Finally we briefly discuss how tools such as
			Vagrant recapture this virtual environment principle for development
			ecosystems that do not have it built-in.</p>

As example, a student with 19 attendance points, 16 homework points, 3 advanced
exercise points, and a 95% on the final exam would receive a final grade of
(3.67+3.33+4.0+.95*4.0) / 4.0 = 3.7, 3.7&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;3.67&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;A.
</p>

<h3>Attendance (25%)</h3>

<p>Attendance is required for this course. Each lecture will begin with a
question from last week&rsquo;s material. A correct answer is worth 2&nbsp;points,
an incorrect answer is worth 1&nbsp;point, and no answer is worth 0&nbsp;points.
The week before spring break is optional with no attendance taken.
The maximum possible attendance score is thus 13&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;26.

<h3>Homeworks (25%)</h3>

<p>There are 12 homeworks in the course. Homework is due by the
<i>beginning</i> of the first lecture the week after it is assigned. Homeworks
will be graded on a {0,1,2} scale:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
	<dt>0 points</dt><dd>No / very little effort</dd>
	<dt>1 point<dd>A solid effort, but not complete</dd>
	<dt>2 points<dd>Completed successfully</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a 1&nbsp;credit course and the homeworks are designed to be
commensurate with that. The goal of the homeworks is to reinforce concepts
introduced in lecture and to give hands-on experience working with tools.</p>
<p>An A&nbsp;student will have at least 18 total homework points (e.g. 6&nbsp;1's and 6&nbsp;2's).</p>

<h3>Advanced Exercises (25%)</h3>

<p>Each homework will have at least one advanced exercise option. The intention
is to give a guided exploration of topics that people find most interesting.
These advanced exercises will also be a little more time consuming, have a little
less guidance, and require you to research and discover a little on your own.
Over the course of the semester, you are expected to do at least three of the
advanced exercises.</p>
<p>The advanced exercises are graded on a simple 0 or 1 system, either you did
the whole thing or you did not. Some weeks may have multiple advanced exercise
options, however you may only earn 1 advanced exercise point per week (though
that shouldn&rsquo;t stop you from doing more if you are interested!).</p>

<h3>Final Exam (25%)</h3>
<p>
The final exam will be cumulative over all of the whole term.
We have a 90-minute time slot for the exam.
This is a very broad course. The exam is not designed to be &ldquo;tricky&rdquo;
or test the esoteric corners of things presented in lecture. A student who
attended every lecture and completed all the homeworks will likely need minimal
studying for this exam.
