To receive credit for this assignment you will need to stop by someone's
office hours, demo your running code, and answer some questions.


\section{Git Golf}

Sometimes, when using git, people make mistakes. Git can be remarkably
forgiving, if you've ever told git to remember something, then you can usually
find a way to undo your mistake and get it back.

\subsection*{\#1: Undeleting Files}

In this repository, someone got a little trigger happy and ran
\texttt{git~rm~*.png}, which deleted every image, and committed the result.
Now the website is broken because an image that should have stayed was
deleted. While you could use \texttt{git~revert} to undo the commit, it also
changed the website source, so you really don't want to undo everything.

\noindent
\textbf{Demonstrate how to recover the missing picture \ul{without} reverting
the commit that deleted it.}


\subsection*{\#2: Undeleting Commits}

Sometimes it is possible to lose a commit. This can happen because you deleted
a branch, a rebase went poorly, or a reset went awry. Regardless of how it
happened, there are ways of finding commits that nothing is currently pointing
to. This repository has such a commit.

\noindent
\textbf{Demonstrate how to recover a commit that nothing is currently pointing to.}
% n.b. for the pedantic, the r****g is actually pointing to this commit, so
% it'll never be gc'd, but that's outside the scope of this question


\subsection*{\#3: Undeleting Changes}

When working with git, \texttt{git~add~my\_file} stages a file, but it isn't
actually committed until you run \texttt{git~commit}. Sometimes you change
your mind after a \texttt{git~add} and run \texttt{git~reset~my\_file} to
unstage a file. The changes to that file are still there, however. To really
undo changes, you use \texttt{git~reset~-{}-hard}.

\medskip
\noindent
Once you've been using these commands for a little while, it can be a little
too easy to accidentally type the wrong thing. In this repository, someone
accidentally typed \texttt{git~reset~-{}-hard} when they meant to just type
\texttt{git~reset}. Fortunately, because they had already run \texttt{git~add}
to stage their changes, the deleted changes can be recovered.

\noindent
\textbf{Demonstrate how to recover changes that had been staged for commit,
but were then deleted.}

\section{Automating Professionalism}

One feature of most version control systems is \emph{hooks}. A hook is an
automated script or tool that runs at various points in time. For example,
later in this course we will show how you can automatically run test cases
every time anyone commits code.

\medskip
\noindent
A slightly easier one to wire up, however, is a hook that will automatically
check the spelling of your commit messages for you, letting you know if you
made any mistakes. While spelling rarely counts for a class projects, it
adds a nice bit of professionalism to any future work you'll share with
others.

\medskip
\noindent
Like the regular homework, I recommend creating a temporary git repository to
play with while you test things and try to get things working.

\medskip
\noindent
Git stores all of its information and configuration in a folder named
\texttt{.git} in the root of each project. Navigate to \texttt{.git/hooks} and
rename \texttt{commit-msg.sample} to \texttt{commit-msg}. This activates the
commit message hook, which runs after you write and save your commit message.
Now go back to your repository, make a change, and commit it. Hmm, doesn't
look like anything changed. Make another change, but this time make this your
commit message (\textbf{exactly this, capitalization matters}):
\begin{quote}
  \begin{verbatim}
  This is a test.

  Signed-off-by: Me!
  Signed-off-by: Me!\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
After trying to commit, type \texttt{git status}. What happened? Go back and
look at the commit hook. Do you understand what it does? Try running
\texttt{git commit --no-verify} with the same commit message. Go edit the
commit hook and delete the line \texttt{exit 1}. Try making a new commit with
the same commit message, what happens now? What is \texttt{\$1} in this
script?  (not sure? try adding lines like \texttt{echo~\$1} or
\texttt{echo~\$(file~\$1)} or \texttt{echo~\$(cat~\$1)} to the hook and making
commits, what happens?)

\medskip
\noindent
\texttt{aspell} is a simple command-line utility that checks spelling. Install
it and play with it a little.

\medskip
\noindent
\textbf{Write a commit hook that checks the spelling of a commit message.}
Your hook should not prevent the commit from going through (that'd be
annoying..), but it should print out any spelling errors. Your hook should
also print a message that suggests running the command
\texttt{git~commit~-{}-amend}\footnote{
  Amending a commit lets you change your most recent commit. This is fine when
  you are working locally, but can be a dangerous command if you are sharing
  your repository with anyone else. Use with caution.
} if any errors are present.

\medskip
\noindent
Many commit messages will include snippets of code or a quote of a log or
something else to help explain the commit. By convention, quoted blocks are
indented with spaces.

Fix error on edit items page

Need to handle the string "None", which isn't a number, fixes:

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...<snip>...
    File "chezbetty-1.4.1.egg/chezbetty/templates/admin/item_edit.jinja2", line 56, in <module>
      <dt>Days Until Out</dt> <dd>{{ stats.until_out|round(0)|int }}</dd>
    File "Jinja2-2.7.3-py3.4.egg/jinja2/filters.py", line 657, in do_round
      return round(value, precision)
  TypeError: type str doesn't define __round__ method

Fixes #172.

It does not make sense to spell check the quoted material, however.

\medskip
\noindent
\textbf{Modify your commit hook so that it does not spellcheck any line that
begins with at least two spaces.}

\medskip
\noindent
{\small \emph{Hint: Having trouble? Don't be afraid to use \texttt{/tmp} to
    store some files. You don't need to make any temporary files to do this
    task, but it can make things easier, especially when you're first learning.
}}

\subsection*{Submission checkoff:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[$\square$] Show off your spellchecking hook in action
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[$\square$] Demonstrate that it ignores errors in indented lines
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Further exploration and some gotchas:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Take a look at some of the other hooks, are any of them useful?
  \item For a list of all available hooks, type \texttt{man githooks}.
  \item Hooks have to be marked as executable to run (\texttt{chmod +x}). The
    sample hooks already had the executable bit set, which is why renaming the
    existing sample worked above.
  \item Hooks can call other scripts. Because invocation of hooks is
    controlled by the name of the script, if you want multiple scripts to run
    for a single hook, you'll need to have one script named correctly that
    calls your other hooks.
\end{itemize}
